### Transport simulations with multiple agents written in JavaScript

This repository contains multi-agent transport simulations for various scenarions.

Current implementations:

1. Elevator Simulation: Simulates a transport problem with an elevator in a building with 10 floors. Agents keep arriving at fixed or random intervals each with a source and destination floor. Agents call the elevator and if elevator is on their floor, they enter it (if capacity is not full). All processes are shown visually in the browser
